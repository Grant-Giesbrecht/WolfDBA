****************** WolfDBA Usage Suggestions *****************
**************************************************************

Installation:

	1. Create a bconf file containing all account information.
	   Install the bconf file in a directory on the MATLAB path
	   so you can locate it just with the file name. ~/Documents
	   /MATLAB/ is one such example. 

	2. Add your database files (KV1Bank files) to the directory
	   you specified in you bconf file.

	3. Download the .m files of WolfDBA. Put them in a directory
	   on the MATLAB path. We advise that you put them in their
	   own directory and add that directory to the MATLAB path.
	   MATLAB has instructions on how to do that.

			-- Now you're all set! --


Usage/Scripting:
    
    This section will describe how we recommend you structure your
    scripts. Although not all will look like this, this is the 
    boilerplate that works best for 90% of your progams and scripts.
    Plus, this will get you familiar with the system and comfortable
    making your own system.

	1. ACCESS THE DATABASE: We recommend using load_data(). It makes
	   calls to the two functions used for reading WolfDBA's two file
	   types - load_kv1bank() and load_kv1bconf(). It uses load_kv1bconf
	   to read your bconf and find your accounts and their data files.
	   It then uses load_kv1bank() for each data file to read in your
	   database.
	   
	   ex: load_data("your_file.bconf", "db");

    	2. FILTER ACCOUNTS & ENTRIES: Use filter_acct() to access the
	   accounts you're interested in. Use filter_entries() to 
	   access entries of interest.

	3. DISPLAY DATA: Use get_vectors() to convert your account objects 
	   into vectors which can be plotted easily with MATLAB's 
	   built-in plotting functions.
